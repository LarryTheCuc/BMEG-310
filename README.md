Compilation of R code used for machine learning and data analysis

THIS IS NOT AN ACTIVE GITHUB, rather an archive of the various lab assignments and a final project aimed at applying machine learning algorithms to medical contexts.

This repository represents the combined work of Daniel Hinatsu, Alexandra Murphy and SJ Patel. The code is created for and adapted from UBC's BMEG 310 signal processing course
